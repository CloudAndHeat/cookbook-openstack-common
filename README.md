Description
===========

Cookbook containing common setup recipes and attributes that describe
an OpenStack deployment.

Requirements
============

* Chef 0.8+

Cookbooks
---------

The following cookbooks are dependencies:

* apt
* database

Attributes
==========

Please see the extensive inline documentation in `attributes/default.rb` for descriptions
of all the settable attributes for this cookbook.

Note that all attributes are in the `default["openstack"]` "namespace"

Libraries
=========

This cookbook exposes a set of default library routines:

* `endpoint` -- Used to return a `::URI` object representing the named OpenStack endpoint
* `endpoints` -- Useful for operating on all OpenStack endpoints
* `db` -- Returns a Hash of information about a named OpenStack database
* `db_uri` -- Returns the SQLAlchemy RFC-1738 DB URI (see: http://rfc.net/rfc1738.html) for a named OpenStack database
* `db_create_with_user` -- Creates a database and database user for a named OpenStack database
* `secret` -- Returns the value of an encrypted data bag for a named OpenStack secret key and key-section
* `db_password` -- Ease-of-use helper that returns the decrypted database password for a named OpenStack database
* `service_password` -- Ease-of-use helper that returns the decrypted service password for named OpenStack service
* `user_password` -- Ease-of-use helper that returns the decrypted password for a Keystone user

Usage
-----

The following are code examples showing the above library routines in action.
Remember when using the library routines exposed by this library to include
the Openstack routines in your recipe's `::Chef::Recipe` namespace, like so:

```ruby
class ::Chef::Recipe
  include ::Openstack
end
```

Example of using the `endpoint` routine:

```ruby
nova_api_ep = endpoint "compute-api"
::Chef::Log.info("Using Openstack Compute API endpoint at #{nova_api_ep.to_s}")

# Note that endpoint URIs may contain variable interpolation markers such
# as `%(tenant_id)s`, so you may need to decode them. Do so like this:

require "uri"

puts ::URI.decode nova_api_ap.to_s
```

Example of using the `db_password` and `db_uri` routine:

```ruby
db_pass = db_password "cinder"
db_user = node["cinder"]["db"]["user"]
sql_connection = db_uri "volume", db_user, db_pass

template "/etc/cinder/cinder.conf" do
  source "cinder.conf.erb"
  owner  node["cinder"]["user"]
  group  node["cinder"]["group"]
  mode   00644
  variables(
    "sql_connection" => sql_connection
  )
end
```

OpenStack Role Operations      
-------------------------      
  
To find a hash (or partial hash) of configuration information given a named Chef
role, use the `Openstack::config_by_role` routine. This routine takes as its 
first parameter the name of the Chef role to look for. An optional second parameter
is the section of the node hash to return. If nil, the whole node hash is returned.

```ruby
role_name = node["openstack"]["chef_roles"]["identity_server"]
identity_conf = ::Openstack::config_by_role(role_name)
identity_conf_creds_section = ::Openstack::config_by_role(role_name, "creds")
```

URI Operations
--------------

Use the `Openstack::uri_from_hash` routine to helpfully return a `::URI::Generic`
object for a hash that contains any of the following keys:

* `host`
* `uri`
* `port`
* `path`
* `scheme`

If the `uri` key is in the hash, that will be used as the URI, otherwise the URI will be
constructed from the various parts of the hash corresponding to the keys above.

```ruby
# Suppose node hash contains the following subhash in the :identity_service key:
# {â‹…
#   :host => 'identity.example.com',
#   :port => 5000,
#   :scheme => 'https'
# }
uri = ::Openstack::uri_from_hash(node[:identity_service])
# uri.to_s would == "https://identity.example.com:5000"
```

The routine will return nil if neither a `uri` or `host` key exists in the supplied hash.

Using the library without prefixing with ::Openstack
----------------------------------------------------

Don't like prefixing calls to the library's routines with `::Openstack`? Do this:

```ruby
class ::Chef::Recipe
  include ::Openstack
end
```

in your recipe.

Testing
=====

This cookbook is using [ChefSpec](https://github.com/acrmp/chefspec) for
testing. Should run the following before commiting. It will run your tests,
and check for lint errors.

    % ./run_tests.bash
